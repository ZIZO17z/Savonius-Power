            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Egypt faces several critical challenges that hinder its path to sustainable development. The project aims to reduce and adapt to the effects of the climatic change, improving the use of alternative energies, improving the scientific and technological environment for all, addressing & reducing pollution in air, water, and soil, and population growth. The study aims to generate electricity from wind power to decrease dependence on fossil fuels. The problem to be solved is Addressing Electricity Deficiency in STEM October using Savonius Wind Turbine Technology. The solution is a Savonius Helical wind turbine with design requirements that make the turbine generate electrical energy not least 40 joules at a wind speed of 4 to 6 meters per five minutes. The weight of the turbine should also be light, not exceeding 10 kilograms. After finishing the prototype, some negative results were found and solved, in addition to the positive results. The momentous findings were that the project produced 63.57 joules in 5 minutes, also it matched the design requirements of the volume, which is 0.5 m². The major conclusion is that the prototype is efficient in solving the problem while maintaining the ability to solve the grand challenges.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Egypt has faced many grand challenges that should be addressed to keep up with the era. These crises include the lack of usage of alternative energies, delay in the scientific and technological environment for all, an increase in the rate of pollution in air, water, and soil, the harmful effects of climate change, and population growth and its consequences.</p>
        
        <p>Egypt secured the 86th position among 113 teams in the Global Innovation Index (GII) in 2024. This shows Egypt's lack of technological environment. Also, 89 percent of Egypt's electric sources are fossil fuels. It depends on the alternative Energy by about 11 percent in 2024, as shown in Figure 1. That's below the average rate, which is about 42 percent of the total usage. That leads to an increase in air, water, and soil pollution due to the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

        <h3>Design Requirements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The output power must exceed 40 joules in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The efficiency of the project must exceed 15%.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Test Plan</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Calculating the output watts. The project was tested at high wind speeds. The generator was connected to the multimeter. Then, it started to read the output amperes and volts of the generator, as shown in Figure 8. The reading was taken every 5 seconds for 5 minutes.

        </ol>
        
        <h2>Results</h2>
        
        <h3>Negative Results</h3>
        <p>While testing the prototype, it produced 2 negative results. First, the high revolution the rotor made within a second results in its instability, so we added more adhesive liquid in addition to a bearing wheel.</p>
        <p>Second, while measuring the number of volts produced from the prototype using the multimeter, the prototype production doesn't exceed 0.5V, so we replace the existing wires with new low-resistance wires to increase the voltage.</p>
        
        <h3>Positive Result</h3>
        <p>After constructing the prototype and testing it in real life. The prototype revolves at under 70 RPM, under the influence of wind velocity from 2m/s to 2.5 m/s. In addition, a maximum amount of 2.19v volts and 0.16 amperes. with a maximum of 0.35 watts. Our prototype is operated with an efficiency of 18%, as in Figure 10, according to table 2.</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The helical Savonius wind rotor is composed of structures like the central shaft and the helical blades. The central shaft, where the helical blades are connected, is a vertical axis that transmits the rotational energy from the blades to the generator or the mechanical system. The blades are twisted like &lt;S&gt; when viewed from the top, with a 180-degree angle to the bottom with a gap space (overlap denoted as e); this twist ensures a constant in contact with the air, in addition to capturing wind from all directions.</p>
        
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="Picture11.png" alt="Typical helical savonius style VAWT">
            <div class="figure-caption">Figure 11: Typical helical savonius style VAWT</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The helical Savonius wind turbine dimensions, as shown in Figure 11, include an overlap ratio. Since there is an overlap among the width of the rotor, the width of the whole rotor (D) = 2 × the diameter of one blade (d) – e.</p>
        
        <p>After some calculations based on many researches, we finally reached that the final dimensions of the rotor are 0.977m high, 0.64m width.</p>
        
        <p>Since the blades takes the helical shape, we calculated the dimensions of the blades before twisting based on calculation of helical path which are: 0.579m width, 0.977m high and the helical path of 1.39m.</p>
        
        <h3>Mechanical Analysis</h3>
        <p>Our wind turbine design is based on semi-hollow hemispherical blades, each pair consisting of a concave blade facing the wind direction and a convex blade on the opposite side. The concave blade collects the wind and directs it through a very narrow passage between the two blades(e), directing the airflow toward the convex blade.</p>
        
        <p>This narrow passage increases the air velocity according to the continuity equation:</p>
        <p>A<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></p>
        
        <p>Since the cross-sectional area A<sub>2</sub> is smaller than A<sub>1</sub>, the velocity V<sub>2</sub> must increase. As a result, the pressure decreases according to Bernoulli's equation:</p>
        <p>P<sub>1</sub> + ½ ρV<sub>1</sub>² + ρgh<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> + ½ ρV<sub>2</sub>² + ρgh<sub>2</sub></p>
        
        <p>In other words, as the velocity increases, the pressure decreases. The pressure difference between the concave and convex blades generates a force that causes the turbine to rotate. This force generates torque, which is calculated using the following formula:</p>
        <p>τ = r × F sin(α)</p>
        
        <p>Where r is the distance from the point of force application to the vertical axis of rotation. Therefore, we designed the turbine with a large radius to maximize torque output.</p>
        
        <p>The aerodynamic force imbalance between the concave and convex blades is a key feature of our design. Concave blades capture more wind force than convex blades, ensuring continuous rotation, even at low wind speeds. As the turbine rotates around the vertical axis, the forces are distributed evenly, increasing the system's stability and balance.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, the vertical shaft is connected to an electrical generator, which converts the mechanical energy of rotation into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. This energy is then stored in a rechargeable battery for later use, ensuring efficient and sustainable power generation.</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
        <p>While choosing the materials that will be used as blades or shafts. We took into consideration some physical properties such as yield strength, young's modulus, and density. The galvanized steel was chosen to act as the blades of the turbine. Galvanized steel is steel that undergoes galvanization, this process involves adding a zinc layer to the steel to prevent it from rusting. That's why galvanized steel is known for its long durability. Adding a layer of zinc to the steel doesn't affect the regular steel strength; the galvanized steel retains the strength of the regular steel, which is 500MPa (mega pascal) in addition to 20GPa Young's modulus. The galvanized steel has a suitable weight with a density of 7850kg/m³, providing a balance between strength and efficiency, not too heavy to reduce efficiency; however, it's heavy enough to offer inertia and strength during rotation. Since our blades are twisted into a helical path so 20GPA Young's modulus offers a great ability to be twisted without binding or being deformed without returning to the original shape, with a higher ability to resist wind loads. In addition to all these pros, galvanized steel is cost-effective than other materials such as stainless steel and aluminum. Making it the best option for constructing the blades.</p>
        
        <h3>Power Output</h3>
        <p>The Savonius wind turbine is a drag-type vertical-axis wind turbine. Meaning it relies mainly on aerodynamic drag, not lift, to rotate. The drag force is the force acting in the direction of the flow, and it's given by this equation:</p>
        <p>F<sub>d</sub> = ½ ρ × C<sub>d</sub> × A × v²</p>
        
        <p>Where ρ is the density of the air (1.225kg/m³), C<sub>d</sub> is the drag coefficient (1.3 on the concave side, 0.5 on the convex side), A is the projected area of the blade (0.3104m²), and v is the wind speed.</p>
        
        <p>So, the drag force on the concave side is = 1.195 N. (theoretically)</p>
        <p>While on the convex side, its = 0.46N. (theoretically)</p>
        
        <p>After calculating the drag force on each side then the torque that will be generated = r × (concave drag force - convex drag force) where r the distance from the axis of rotation to the outer edge of the blades. So, the torque will be = 0.236NM (theoretically).</p>
        
        <p>To calculate the power output of the generator, we use the formula:</p>
        <p>P = ½ ρ × A × v³</p>
        
        <p>After these calculations, the power output of the generator is approximately 1.88 watts.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The prototype aims to solve the problem to be solved, which is addressing the Electricity Deficiency in STEM October using Savonius Wind Turbine Technology. The required solution is a Savonius Helical wind turbine, which moves due to the drag force, hence generating electricity using a Direct Current motor. Some negative results were found. The positive results are that the project meets the design requirements, as it can generate about 63.57 joules per 5 minutes, and the weight of the project doesn't exceed 10 kilograms; the efficiency of converting wind energy into electrical energy exceeds 15%. The project can generate electricity using low-speed wind; hence, this will help generate more electricity.</p>
        
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        
        <h3>Real-life Application</h3>
        <p>The recommended place to apply the solution is STEM High School for Boys - 6th of October in the El Giza governorate, as shown in Figure 12. At school, it was discovered that the school spends approximately 75 thousand pounds monthly on electricity consumption, which is a critical issue for the school's financial situation. The school has about 80 personal computers distributed across two labs and a total of 2,392 lamps, each consuming between 8 and 20 watts; hence, a lot of electricity will be consumed at a high cost. Since the air velocity is high in the school, the proper solution is to use a vertical-axis wind turbine. Due to the low space in this location, the project will be sufficient as vertical-axis wind, since turbines require a small area to work. Affording a renewable energy source will lessen the financial overload on the school. As a result of this, the project blades will be about 180 cm high and 60 cm wide.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Wind-Solar Hybrid System</h3>
        <p>Wind-Solar Hybrid System is an alternative energy power generation system that depends on two sources of energy: Photovoltaic energy and wind energy, as shown in Figure 13. Hence, maximizing energy production, this system is useful in fluctuating weather patterns, as in STEM High School for Boys - 6th of October in El-Giza governorate. This combination helps in reducing the dependence on non-renewable energy sources. On the other hand, this will help gather more energy in a small area. Especially the two sources are available in STEM High School for Boys - 6th of October school for boys, as the solar power is about 6 kWh/m²/day in the region where the school is, so this will provide a high advantage to use solar energy in combination with wind in this location.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Maglev Dynamo</h3>
        <p>The maglev dynamo shown in Figure 14 is unique for suspending the blades without equipment. That happens by defeating the environment using magnetic fields. This system works on the magnetic induction theory. This dynamo uses two similar poles of a magnet to create repulsion, and this reduces the vibration by 30% and the friction between the blade and the dynamo's surface. The less friction means that the rotation will be smoother. So, the rotational velocity will increase, the efficiency will increase, and the output power will increase. Thus, it will be more efficient than the normal dynamo. Its efficiency is more than 87%. As a result, the maglev dynamo is recommended to be used in a real-life application. We couldn't use it because of its high cost and volume.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Using Glass Fiber Instead of Aluminum Sheets</h3>
        <p>Aluminum sheets used in manufacturing blades of wind turbines are so heavy compared to glass fiber, as shown in Figure 15. This is because the Fiberglass composite pultruded wind turbine blades meet the most sophisticated standards to refine wind energy principles and make wind energy economically feasible for mass consumption. Studies have shown that fiberglass blades can improve electrical output by up to 20% compared to aluminum blades. On the other hand, Glass fibers often make up to 50% of the composite, a combination of materials, such as polymers and fibers, used to create wind turbine blades. Hence, increasing the recycling process. The reason that prevents us from using it is its high cost.</p>
